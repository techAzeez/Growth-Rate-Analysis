# Growth-Rate-Analysis
**By Azeez Adewale**
# Introduction:
 I decided to put my data analytics skill to practice so i got this dataset from kaggle, though the dataset seem to have very little little information but for my analytical instinct, i was still able to draw insight from it.
# Project Goals: Problem Statement
To better understand the changes that occurred in the sales of products over a period one year.
This will help us to:
* Identify what the state of the online store is in terms of revenue.
* Come up with strategies to either maintain or improve the current State.

**Key Questions**
* What is the month on month sales revenue and growth rate?
* What is the quater on quater sales revenue and growth rate?
* Revenue forecast for the next one year.
